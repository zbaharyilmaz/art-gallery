# Van Gogh Art Gallery

Welcome to the Van Gogh Art Gallery project! This web application showcases the iconic artworks of Vincent Van Gogh, providing an interactive and visually appealing gallery experience. The app is built using **React** for the frontend and **Sass** for styling, ensuring a modern and smooth user interface.

## Demo

## Features

- **View Artworks:** Users can view high-resolution images of different artworks.
- **Artist Information:** Along with the artwork, information about the artist is also displayed.
- **Different Categories:** Explore artworks based on various categories of interest.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A minimalist design and easy navigation for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- **Sass**: A powerful CSS preprocessor that extends CSS with features like variables, nested rules, and mixins to make the styling process more efficient.
- **CSS Modules**: A CSS file where all class and animation names are scoped locally by default. This helps avoid conflicts by ensuring styles are isolated to the components.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) features like arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, and async/await for more readable and concise code.
